## Assignment 4: RNA-seq and Machine Learning
Assignment Date: Monday, October 7, 2024 <br>
Due Date: Monday, October 14 @ 11:59pm <br>

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will explore a couple of key aspects of RNA-seq and introduce the key concepts of machine learning. For this assignment, we will provide a Jupyter notebook with code for you to use and complete your assignment in. 

To use the Jupyter notebook, create a new mamba environment for assignment 4:

`mamba create -n asn4 scikit-learn pytorch matplotlib jupyter umap-learn seaborn pandas numpy`

Make sure to download the training data for the assignment from [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ixnit6id1setj4/X_train.tsv.gz?e=1&dl=0). Place this in the `data_files` directory and make sure to uncompress (`gunzip`) both the training and testing files. 

As a reminder, any questions about the assignment should be posted to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/m09t5q6qles40a).

See the notebook here: [Assignment4.ipynb](Assignment4.ipynb)


### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, and all relevant code, text, and figures (as needed). If you use ChatGPT for any of the code, also record the prompts used. Submit your solutions by uploading the PDF to [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/839343), and remember to select where in your submission each question/subquestion is. The Entry Code is: Z3J8YV. 

If you submit after this time, you will use your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 4 late days for the entire semester!
