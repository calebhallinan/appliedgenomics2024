## Assignment 5: Convlutional Neural Networks
Assignment Date: Monday, October 21, 2024 <br>
Due Date: Monday, October 28 @ 11:59pm <br>

### Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will explore a couple of key aspects of convolutional neural networks such as self-attention and feature encoding as well as explore a pre-trained convolutional neural network for gene expression prediction. For this assignment, we will provide a Jupyter notebook with code for you to use and complete your assignment in. 

For this assignment, you will create the environment as follows:

`mamba create -n asn5 scikit-learn pytorch matplotlib pandas numpy`

Then activate the environment and install the following packages using pip:

`mamba activate asn5`
`pip install kipoiseq==0.5.2`
`pip install logomaker`
`pip install enformer-pytorch`

Then you need to install Jupyter:

`mamba install jupyter`

As a reminder, any questions about the assignment should be posted to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/m09t5q6qles40a).

See the notebook here: [Assignment5.ipynb](Assignment5.ipynb)


### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, and all relevant code, text, and figures (as needed). If you use ChatGPT for any of the code, also record the prompts used. Submit your solutions by uploading the PDF to [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/839343), and remember to select where in your submission each question/subquestion is. The Entry Code is: Z3J8YV. 

If you submit after this time, you will use your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 4 late days for the entire semester!
